# Produce-Spatial-Parameters_R

Produced spatial parameters are important steps for any kind of topic in natural research, Such as: hazard/susceptibilty level of disaster, forestry, urban planning, minning, structural engineering and ect. In this section i will intoduced some method for producing the spatial parameters that might be usefull in all of the topics above, especially in hazard/susceptibility of natural disazter-it already become mandatory input.

Performing RSAGA in R is increasing our productivity while dealing with a bunch of data, morover if our duty is repeated again-again. Basically RSAGA are combination of SAGA-GIS tools with R programming languange. It means, we can easily run the SAGA-GIS tools trought the R programming languange.
